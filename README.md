===========

This is my micro framework for fun, I had to work on a school project and wanted to use Symfony, but it was a bit to much for our project, so I came up with that.
It is inspired from Symfony and use a few of Symfony composant. But i would like to create my own for fun, it is inspired from this tuto from  Fabien Potencier
http://fabien.potencier.org/article/50/create-your-own-framework-on-top-of-the-symfony2-components-part-1

I will try to implement everything that I want, and it will be a good work to understand how Symfony work.

There is also a template engine Twig, and I will try to add new component
